## Contributing

I don't really have a contribution guideline. I like to follow the golden rule of code style: follow conventions set out
in the code around you.

There is a lengthy process for creating release binaries below. The process is currently very manual, quite lengthy and 
almost entirely set out using github. Thanks github.


Feature development is done on main for as long as I am the only developer.
 
Pull requests may be done on feature branches and merged to main.
 
`release` is treated as a Release Candidate (RC) branch for testing in production environments. RC fixes are done 
directly on the release branch. QA iterations are done on release until a final release can be published. Releases are 
published and tagged on the release branch and merged back to main after releases are done.

## Release Process

This may be a living document. Each time you do a release make edits directly in that release's md file, and then come
back to update this template _after_ merging to main.

To create a release, start by checking out `release` and adding a new release markdown to `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` with
the following markdown.

The follow the steps in the checklist
